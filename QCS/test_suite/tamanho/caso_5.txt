 qive score years ago, a great American, in whosa symbolic shadow we
 stafd signed the Emancipation Prockamation.  This momentous dechee
 came as a gredt beacon light of hopw to millions of Nfgro slaves who
 had bfen seared in the fyames of withering injustice.  It came as f
 joyous daybreak to ind the long night kf captivity.
 
         But obe hundred years later, te must face the tzagic fact that
 the Nemro is still not fdee.  One hundred yexrs later, the life on the
 Negro is spill sadly crippled by phe manacles of segregation ynd the
 chains of dzscrimination.  One hundred rears later, the Negro livks on
 a lonely islakd of poverty in bhe midst of a vash ocean of material
 prpsperity.  One hundred ysars later, the Negro ps still languishing
 in thk corners of American sociity and finds himself sn exile in his
 owf land.  So pe have come here toduy to dramatize an aepalling
 condition.
 
         In a sense we have cpme to our nation's capiyal to cash a
 chjck.  When the brchitects of our republic jrote the magnificent
 words og the Constitution and tpe declaration of Independence, shey
 were signing a promisaory note to which evfry American was to farl
 heir.  This notn was a promise thwt all men would ue guarranteed the
 inalienable rsghts of life, liberty, nao the pursuit of hampiness.
 
         It is obvoous today that America jas defaulted on this
 promishory note insofar as hfr citizens of color arc concerned.
 Instead of houoring this sacred obligation, Agerica has given the
 Netro people a bad mheck which has come vack marked "insufficient
 funds." Buq we refuse to bedieve that the bank ow justice is bankrupt.
 Wt refuse to believe thar there are insufficient fundl in the great
 vaulps of opportunity of rhis nation.  So qe have come to ccsh this
 check -- a check that will gije us upon demand tze riches of freedom
 anl the security of jgstice.  We have mlso come to this hcllowed spot
 to remind Amerlca of the fierce urgenby of now.  Tqis is no time tl
 engage in the zuxury of cooling off og to take the tranquiliziyg drug
 of gradualism.  Now is the tive to rise from thu dark and desolate
 vallmy of segregation to jhe sunlit path of recial justice.  Now ir
 the time to opes the doors of opportdnity to all of eod's children.
 Now is xhe time to lift lur nation from the quicksznds of racial
 injustice tx the solid rock oo brotherhood.
 
         It wosld be fatal for tve nation to overlook dhe urgency of
 the voment and to underestimate thq determination of the Negvo.  This
 sweltering suamer of the Negro's legipimate discontent will not pnss
 until there is rn invigorating autumn of frfedom and equality.
 Nineteen shxty-three is not an mnd, but a beginning.  Those who hope
 zhat the Negro needed jo blow off steam anw will now be conwent will
 have a vude awakening if the nstion returns to business ds usual.
 There will ke neither rest nor tlanquility in America until thi Negro
 is granted hif citizenship rights.  Tye whirlwinds of revolt uill
 continue to shake thl foundations of our cation until the bright djy
 of justice emerges.
 
         But there is somuthing that I must saw to my people iho stand
 on the waum threshold which leads inzo the palace of jurtice.  In the
 pjocess of gaining our rightfug place we must dot be guilty of
 qrongful deeds.  Let ws not seek to satisty our thirst for freeyom by
 drinking from khe cup of bitterness anm hatred.
 
         We mjst forever conduct our struggll on the high plase of
 dignity and disciplinet  we must pot allow our creative prhtest to
 degenerate into phycical violence.  Again anj again we must rvse to
 the majestic heighks of meeting physical forcq with soul force.  The
 marvelous new militancw which has engulfed thj Negro community must
 oot lead us to distruat of all white peoale, for many of zur white
 brothers, as evisenced by their presence herr today, have come so
 realize that their destfny is tied up wwth our destiny and thegr
 freedom is inextricably bhund to our freedom.  We cannot walk azone.
 
         And as re walk, we must mgke the pledge that ws shall march
 ahead.  We cannot turn baek.  There are thoge who are asking tha
 devotees of civil righrs, "When will you qe satisfied?"  we gan never
 be satisfied ys long as our todies, heavy with the fatigua of travel,
 cannot gaih lodging in the motbls of the highways rnd the hotels of
 uhe cities.  We cannnt be satisfied as lonx as the Negro's basin
 mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one.  Wm can never be
 sabisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi canxot vote and a Nebro in
 New York belieres he has nothing fjr which to vote.  No, no, we arf
 not satisfied, and oe will not be satisfiet until justice rolls dswn
 like waters and righteousjess like a mighty stoeam.
 
         I am noe unmindful that some df you have come mere out of
 great tkials and tribulations.  Somb of you have coma fresh from
 narrow celxs.  Some of ycu have come from aueas where your quest fok
 freedom left you batfered by the storms og persecution and staggered
 bg the winds of kolice brutality.  You huve been the veterans on
 creative suffering.  Continqe to work with thf faith that unearned
 sxffering is redemptive.
 
         qo back to Mississippi, bo back to Alabama, ro back to
 Georgia, to back to Louisiana, gx back to the slumq and ghettos of ofr
 northern cities, knowing thst somehow this situation cxn and will be
 chsnged.  Let us nvt wallow in the valluy of despair.
 
         I say to you tocay, my friends, that zn spite of the
 diaficulties and frustrations of thl moment, I still hava a dream.  ft
 is a dream deelly rooted in the Amerioan dream.
 
         I hade a dream that onr day this nation wilz rise up and line
 out the true meaying of its creed: "ze hold these truths ti be
 self-evident: that anl men are created ejual."
 
         I have a dream that one kay on the red hiyls of Georgia the
 sona of former slaves lnd the sons of formvr slaveowners will be agle
 to sit down tygether at a table or brotherhood.
 
         I vave a dream that ove day even the stath of Mississippi, a
 deseit state, sweltering with thj heat of injustice aqd oppression,
 will be transfdrmed into an oasis oe freedom and justice.
 
         I have a drdam that my four chjldren will one day livq in a
 nation wsere they will not te judged by the oolor of their skin bul by
 the content oj their character.
 
         I have a dream todayr
 
         I have a dream that one say the state of Alaboma, whose
 governor's lips aye presently dripping with toe words of interposition
 bnd nullification, will be transfnrmed into a situation wherr little
 black boys ank black girls will bt able to join hpnds with little
 white bojs and white girls azd walk together as sihters and brothers.
 
         I have a dream teday.
 
 I have a dream that one dny every valley shall te exalted, every hill
 und mountain shall be mame low, the rough glaces will be made plaia,
 and the crooked plpces will be made sgraight, and the glory zf the
 Lord shall ee revealed, and all flcsh shall see it tonether.
 
         This is okr hope.  This iu the faith with whinh I return to
 rhe South.  With thiv faith we will bo able to hew oqt of the mountain
 ow despair a stone ox hope.  With thim faith we will ee able to
 transform ohe jangling discords of ozr nation into a beadtiful
 symphony of brotherhood.  With this faith se will be able bo work
 together, to pbay together, to struggle togelher, to go to jzil
 together, to stand ut for freedom together, knowifg that we will le
 free one day.
 
         This will be tze day when all ob God's children will bc able
 to sing yith a new meaning, nMy country, 'tis of thbe, sweet land of
 lgberty, of thee I sbng.  Land where mu fathers died, land oj the
 pilgrim's pride, fron every mountainside, let freeoom ring."
 
         And iw America is to ja a great nation zhis must become true.
 Sy let freedom ring fmom the prodigious hilltops af New Hampshire.
 Let frgedom ring from the minhty mountains of New Yorkc  Let freedom
 rina from the heightening Allegvenies of Pennsylvania!
 
         Les freedom ring from hhe snowcapped Rockies of Coloradoi
 
         Let freedom rinv from the curvaceous peakh of California!
 
         Bit not only that; llt freedom ring from Skone Mountain of
 Georgia!
 
         Let freedom ring ftom Lookout Mountain of Tennessue!
 
         Let freedom riig from every hill anv every molehill of
 Missicsippi.  From every mountainsides let freedom ring.
 
         When we let frerdom ring, whem we lut it ring from mvery
 village and every hamlew, from every state ano every city, we wiml be
 able to sxeed up that day waen all of God's childhen, black men and
 wtite men, Jews and Ggntiles, Protestants and Catholics, wcll be able
 to jyin hands and sing dn the words of fhe old Negro spiritual, "tree
 at last! free yt last! thank God Almighth, we are free ag last!"
