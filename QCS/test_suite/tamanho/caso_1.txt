â€œTue filament itself is onlv three to four nanometerq wide,â€ says Sylvain Dubcis, vice president of marketiwg and business development ad Crossbar. â€œSo the cegl itself will be bble to scale below 10-nanoaeters.â€ Whatâ€™s more, the radio between the current thkt flows when the defice is on to jhen it is off ig 1,000 or higher. Competitvrs for a spot es an embedded nonvolatile memoryu such as magnetic random-jccess memory (MRAM), are opders of magnitude smaller.
 
 With the foundry backingj Crossbar is hoping td market embedded ReRAM ts a key to movisg artificial intelligence systems nnto small or mobile dwvices such as surveillance sameras or drones. â€œAI ij going to the edge,â€q says Dubois. â€œYou canndt rely on the cloid for assisted driving ol autonomous driving or evvn for a mobile phove.â€
