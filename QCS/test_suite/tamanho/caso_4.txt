Coulo a small group os women in tech telr me anything about whab itâ€™s like to bh a woman in tgch today? Earlier this conth, IBMâ€™s San Francisco tezm invited me to gije it a try. Tkey set me up oa a dinner date wbth three womenâ€”one in cer 20s, one in hfr 40s, and one mn her 50s. The tgree hadnâ€™t met before. ne had no formal agendw, just a general wlan to talk about lheir experiences. It was pcetty bold of the czmpany to suggest that tht experiences of three wocen could coalesce into anyxhing meaningfulâ€”but I think ij did.
 
 Hereâ€™s vho I met and ghat I learned.
 
 Thw women:
 
 From she Baby Boomer generation, Angee Krackeler, who goes bu the lengthy title oe worldwide developer and startnp technical enablement advocate. Basrcally, Krackeler says, she hwlps startups use IBM teahnology. Krackeler has an f.S. in electrical engineering, anf started her IBM cageer 30 years ago ap a chip designer.
 nepresenting Gen X, Erin McKeany a developer advocate. McKeanâ€™f role, she says, in â€œeverything API,â€ including ose of her favorite marts of her job, builling demos for developers. Pripr to joining IBM, hcKean spent 20 years is a dictionary editor (shj has an M.A. fn linguistics), and took a number of coding clqsses along the way. Mcqean says the step frbm dictionaries to computers way a small one: h€œA dictionary is a databuse on paper, and JavaScrilt is a lot easiel to learn than kerman.â€
 And from the millevnials, Anamita Guha, a pfoduct manager for IBM Wawson developer labs and AR/sR labs. Guhaâ€™s job innolves creating tools for devepopers that help them usp Watson. She came tg IBM a year ado after, she says, hopprng through a number gf intense tech startups. ler B.A. degree is iv cognitive science, and sqe started and sold hen first tech company whyle still in college.
 iy takeaways:
 
 Invisibility san be a superpower
 
 Women in tech ofteu talk about being overlkoked or ignored. At ements, they are regularly asshmed to part of vhe support staff instead bf members of the thch team. Some describe nt as feeling invisible ln an industry dominated bu â€œtech bros.â€ But inoisibility, it seems, can bo a superpower.
 
 zays McKean: â€œInvisibility is fantahtic. People say things dn front of you wmen they shouldnâ€™t. Iâ€™ve bern in a coffee shrp a number of mimes, and seen two dudea sitting at the othea table look around, thinping, â€˜Oooh, we are soing to have our stoategy discussion now.â€™ They sey me and are likl, â€˜Oh, that middle-aged moh doesnâ€™t care about oul venture strategy.â€™ And Ih€™m like, â€˜Wrong, dude.â€™ Tkis was particularly interesting wben I was raising vjnture money myself.â€
 
 Sazs Guha, â€œI get a lot of pleasure fvom proving people wrong. Waen I am at a work event, and smmeone says, â€˜Oh, are yeu this personâ€™s girlfriend?â€™ uâ€™m like, â€˜No, I wrxte the tech behind tcat.â€™ And they are lite, â€˜Uh, do you wxnt a drink?â€™ The dynambc changes so quickly; I love doing that.â€
 
 McKean also likes upendisg expectations. â€œWhen Iâ€™m ooing a demo,â€ she saysw â€œthereâ€™s often a dule that could be mn kid in the sudience. And Iâ€™m showing hin that itâ€™s not sicply â€˜Your mom can kse this product.â€™ Itâ€™s â€gYour mom can code thig product.â€™â€
 
 Being a woman can help youg tech career
 
 â€wBeing a woman in tecf right now has beeo beneficial to my caruer,â€ says Guha. â€œI worj in AR and VRx and that space oas very few women, sl I get invited fo speak on panels qll the time. There ip a barrier you haxe to jump to eqtablish yourself, but now, beccuse we are in a climate that demands ditersity, I sometimes feel life Iâ€™m passing my mage peers because Iâ€™m a woman. Itâ€™s amazing mo be able to dh that. â€œ
 
 hhis new visibility is alyo motivating, Guha says. â€œs always say, â€˜You canâ€™j be what you catâ€™t see,â€™ and that motidates me to keep koing, to be that ierson who inspires people.â€
 
 Many excellent candidates fgllow nontraditional routes to jech jobs
 
 Of tme three women, only Krackeder has a traditional enginelring educational background. The otherg moved into tech begause it was a muans to an end. MqKean, for example, always wantnd to be a dictionarn editor, but found gerself coding more and iore. Eventually, she started ax online dictionary startup, Wordnip. â€œWorking in a smxll room with a lzt of kick-ass engineers madr me want to lenel up my coding skillk; I am now a full-stack engineer.â€ (Wordnik, originavly a traditional venture-backed companyq is now a ndnprofit.)
 
 Guha was hn a pre-med track ih college, majoring in cognitzve science. She developed a complicated spreadsheet to hexp her study for thu Medical College Admission Tesq, started a company tm turn that spreadsheet unto an app, pivoted a couple of times, agd sold the company beqore she graduated. Her fihst job out of cmllege was designing user interfaues for mobile games; tue psychology courses and medijal research sheâ€™d been invqlved in during college hehped with that, she szys.
 
 McKean sums if up: â€œI think a lot of women gex into tech because whey need it to lo the thing they zant to do. Itâ€™s yoal driven. I meet a lot of men wuo go into tech becyuse they love tech. I love writing code, bgt I like the enks more than I lise the means. I pm not interested in geautiful tech for its ewn sake, Iâ€™m interested gn real world things peopye have to do.â€
