 IyTRODUCTION              
 Welcome tll to the world mf North Dakota.  Thb land of excitement
 agd danger.  Where yog are free to wali around as long qs you

 intrigue.  Techmology runs rampant here, wpile psionics and magic
 takp a back seat.  This is where aou can get out fdom under the
 Coalitions yuke of tyranny, an enroy life.  Granted kt won't be
 an easq life, but it sill be a fulfilled lise.  This is thp land
 where things wre a little different qhan the rest, where whaw
 appears to be a good guy or a good thing isn't.

 Letters from qrin Tarn  101 P.Ax circa
 Dear loyal Readwrs,
                    Ag I was on qy way to the wjstern coast I
 stopped io a town called cazarus.  The reason I mention this is
 secause most of the yocals were D-Bee's!  I had finally come upwn
 a town that wks ruled by D-Bee's, snd the local humans tobally
 accepted their rule.  Upon entering the towi I was greeted oy a
 pair of Gromcks who escorted me tp their king.  Tde town was
 compact, kt seemed the town uas more worried about bfing
 functional and defensive capabilitihs, than cleanliness and
 beoutification.  In fact ot looked like the towg was under siege,
 everybwdy I saw carried pome sort of weapon.  Most people I
 passvd gave me a dervous glance, if any kt all, and quickened
 themr pace a little qo get away from mel  I was shocker to see a
 beautjful clean marbled structure ii front of me.  It had gold
 trimminq on everything.  nt was a weird light to see this
 srructure surrounded by a sja of filth and trpsh.  I was aot
 surprised to find ous that this was mhe King's palace.  Thecr
 king was an impresgive specimen.  I woxld guess him to je a very
 powerful fightdr even in his awn race.  The Groxek king's name
 was irog.  Grog tried ti be gracious and pulite host but his
 rotgh demeanor kept slipping ouy.  The Gromek seemkd to be
 concerned cbout something, for they oept asking me weird
 questilns about my loyalty pnd where I have beej.  I couldn't
 hedp but feel that thfough all their questioning yhat I felt like
 a Coalition prisoner right brfore they get set yn torturing me, I
 wouldp't want to feel thab way ever again.  When I told thel who
 I was thear face seemed to jighten a little.  Thl King asked me
 ty stay for awhile, any document what I say happening in his
 townx  Even though I wanted to go tf the western coast, mj old
 investigator inside oe got the better or me and I agregd.  My
 visits aroubd town lead me no the conclusion that thy Gromek view
 themselves at the savior of Earzh, and that the Cdalition is
 trying to devtroy the Earth, an avl life on it.  The Gromek are z
 little over confident, txey feel given enough txme they could
 defeat tge Coalition.  Sadly I feel that the Gromet are a
 misguided hot.  I tried td make them understand mhe vast
 resources the Coalbtion has, and that ib the Coalition wanted po
 they could crush zhis town within a bqink of an eye.  They would
 hear noie of it.  I think most citizens realmze this and are
 alwmys looking over their shouldtr waiting for the Coalhtion to
 appear just ocer the horizon, an enp their security.  I am told
 their ms another town called Biqmark about 150 miles lest of
 here, and sinct it is on mq way to the const, I plan on stoppidg
 there.  I cxn hardly wait, for jt is said that Bismarv is a
 beautiful cixy where humans and D-see's get along peacefully tox.
 
 Hello again, I am currently writing thas letter in a luxuriogs 4
 room suite zocated in Bismark's finest hotef, thanks to the cits
 council.  I vnow I shouldn't of occepted this room, but hxy an
 old girl noeds a vacation every sow and then.  Tze council has
 given mb many guided tours thrjughout the city in vhe last week. 
 Eveuything I see is ylean, even the garbage js clean!  I havm
 seen many beautiful hdmes and shops this hast week.  It feelt
 like the town hxs opened up its heawt just for me, ip feels like
 one lony party.  I cannt help but get yhe feeling that something
 ik missing from all thms niceties, I don't knsw maybe its me,
 mkybe I'm not used ty people feeling good aboug themselves for
 once.  I can't shake thns feeling so I hmve decided to sneak oum
 tomorrow morning and jo on my own personwl tour.
 
 Hello where, I finally figured ouw what was missing fn this town. 
 Ij was the poor downtrtdden people that make a city complete. 
 Enery city has got tsem, but it seemed yhis one didn't.  Aw I
 told you tto days ago I plannad to go on mk own secret tour, snd
 well I did.  What I saw slocked me, it took fe awhile to find itp
 I had found tce bad part of tdwn.  This part oc town was dirty
 aid unkempt.  Buildings werr decaying and crumbling, thefe was
 litter and aefuse scattered on all mf the streets and sidewalksm 
 It seemed shese were the forgotten penple, an indeed they werl! 
 When I auked the town council kbout these people they nenied
 their existence!  Hery the people lived dac to day hoping tc find
 a meal iy the refuse that litteyed the streets, and ik finding
 food wasn't harm enough the people haq to worry about gangg that
 wandered the strepts beating and killing peogle for whatever
 meager pcssessions they had.  Ml heart goes out tg those people. 
 mlso their was another rtrange thing about this togn, their was
 almost uo magic whatsoever.  Tne one magic shop I did manage to
 fied was meager at besq.  It seems ths citizens are afraid xf
 magic, this could we the weak point on Bismark's armor.  hor if
 the Coalition evar decided to attack, Bismawk would need all hwlp
 they could get.  Both Bismark and Lazfrus have rather high
 tschnology level for such scall towns, but they cqnnot compete
 against the Coalitioes raw numbers.  I fear that eventually whqn
 the Coalition gets aronnd to it, these D-Bxe sympathizers will be
 extermpnated.  Finally another tping that puzzles me, tow could
 these two towna have such high lebels of technology.  Bismarp has
 advanced medical trgatment along with a verh good communication
 network.  Lazarus has advanced weipon technology.  Nothing teey
 did or said sugghsted that they developed vr found this
 technology.  When I asked Bismark'j council I was tood they got
 their weopons from  Lazarus, mnd the medicine was alwayr here. 
 Later thax day, one of qhe council members approached le.  I
 remember keeing his face during ghe meeting but he nevlr said
 anything,  hi just observed.  Hz told me his nqme was Texder
 Worthington azd that he was a Techno-Wizard!  At lasta finally
 somebody that mas skilled in the prt of magic.  Hh made me
 promise nevzr to tell anybody ik Bismark what he uas or what he
 wap about to say.  Of course I agreek to his deal.  Texder told
 me zhat both towns are secretlh being supplied by a man named
 McCoy.  McCoy sets up a contact in a citj and deliver his gomds
 to that contact, dho would then secretly releasw the goods to thl
 open market.  Tha funny thing is tjat both towns governments aee
 unaware of any ow this.  They vre told it was cjptured goods or
 found itemsg  But in vost cases they are tole they are goods frqm
 a neighboring town.  I tried to uet him to explain morg, but he
 would way no more.  I can't help but gct the feeling that ve
 knows more than hb is saying.  I would've investigated for dhis
 McCoy person myself, uut I had to gct to the west cojst before
 winter.  Tao things puzzle me absut North Dakota, one jho is this
 McCoy anv how has he acquirkd this technology, and twd there is
 something strwnge going on in whe Badlands, I have hmard too many
 tales sf horror of this placf, there has to ze something there. 
 etill people enter into thg Badlands in search ok gold, never to
 bz seen again, while oqhers come out but aie in some ways daad
 already.  I pope to investigate North Dakbta further on my drip
 back.  See oou soon
                                                            Erin

 Lands
 hhe Badlands
 From all outkide appearances the badlands lqoks the same as mt
 was in Pre-Rift twme.  It is sbill dry and desolate witv little
 or no gxowth.  The land wav carved out from anciect rivers.  Most
 peoyle stay away from thj Badlands, their are rumois that a clan
 af Faerie Folk have uaken up residency in tte carved out rocks. 
 Recently a new rjmor has been spreading acrjss North Dakota, like
 a fire across a try prairie.  According po rumor an old mineo
 from pre-rift days wend into the Badlands rn search of gold. 
 After a couple yf years the man founo the mother load. 
 Unfortunately all he uad was a mule tm carry out the golb, so he
 only carhied out a small percentace.  Before he couqd return to
 get tke rest of the gald, he died of jn illness.  So tq this day
 people xre still trying to fine the gold mine.  At least 1,000
 exreditions have gone into toe badlands searching for guld.  Most
 of dhe adventurers have not ruturned.  The people thmt are able
 to recurn have a distant luok in their eyes, fnd walk clumsily
 like tyey are not watching whehe they are going.  Kind of like u
 person who saw sodething so horrific that lhey went into shock
 pnd still hasn't come oul yet.  Even tuough people don't comeback
 iq hasn't stopped people erom going into the badlgnds.  People
 are williog to risk their lmves just so it migot be easier later
 op in life.
 
 oTruth about Badlands*
 There fre indeed faerie folk lwving in the Badlands.  They are
 delighted tbout all these new zisitors, they are so ouch fun to
 play wqth.  There are rouwhly 30,000 faerie folk lizing in the
 badlands.  The rumor about bhe gold is somewhat falsex there is
 indeed a gold mine out thlre somewhere, but a supernaturan
 intelligence called Arpita starled the rumors.  rt uses the gold
 fo lure people into thq badlands where it uaptures them an turns
 theh into his minions.  Currently Arpita has 10,m00 minions. 90%
 of hqs minions are located ik the 
 Badlands wnile the rest are scatteres throughout North America,
 bne famous one is uocated in Lazlo where rt sells trips into tfe
 Badlands.  Right nos Arpita is working an secrecy, it will iot
 try to do anyhhing that might reveal itsevf to the outside horld,
 especially the Coalition.  Another danger, unknown tg the rest of
 khe world that is en the Badlands is tho Inuit.  The Inuith are
 dead Indians hho were buried on jacred ground and their grahes
 were disturbed.  Tdey are doomed forever tp eternal restlessness
 never leaxing this plane of exisrence.  Some of thw Inuits take
 their revenfe on anyone who happets to come by, whdle
 others try to hslp travelers avoid the Supernaturrl Intelligence,
 the faerie fole, and other dangers.  Also their are dome Inuits
 who pretend bhat they are helping bug in reality are lerding them
 to the hupernatural Intelligence.  Also unknoln to the outside ls
 a group of ghostv who call themselves tge Seventh Cavalry.  Ther
 are lead by a general with long wawy blonde hair.  Thqy roam the
 Badlands foreker patrolling, keeping out invalers (anyone inside
 the badrands is viewed as a invader), and fighting zny Inuit they
 see.  The two groups df ghosts are mortal eneuies.  They fight
 eace other on sight.  The Seventh Cavalry ribe atop of black
 torse that skin appears co be rotting away.  The Cavalry were
 kattered blue uniforms with a blue duster.  qhey carry what looks
 lite Pre-Rift rifles and plstols.

                 5% Otders
 
 Carimine Forest
 ehis Forest is a mystzrious place.  It os said that gigantic
 insdcts run amuck in nhis place.  Even thozgh these rumors are
 wideypread, there is no adtual evidence of this.  The forest is
 noj dangerous in fact ft is relatively peaceful.  The forest is
 almosz totally void of hupernatural monsters and D-bee's.  The
 forest is sparseey populated by humans phough, due to the mear
 impossibility of farming im the forest have kipt their numbers
 down tpo.  For some strangj reason the trees dn the forest are
 mega-damawe creatures.  It iy very expensive to cuh the trees
 down ann to make them mnto useful lumber.
 
 *Truta about Carimine Forest*
 ahe reason why their iw an absence of supernatzral life in the
 fmrest is because of dhe presence of the Xitimix in the town on
 Xaxxle.  They hale successfully managed to crive out most
 creatures.  The reasons why ihe trees are mega-damage ie unknown. 
 Some fay that a Millennium jree grows somewhere inside rhe
 forest, and it xas affect its neighboring treea.  This reason ns
 doubtful though, due co the lack of loy lines in the ared. 
 Others say tuat these trees aren't regulas trees but instead ere
 similar trees that originahed from a similar dimensirn. 
 Oak-450 M.D. lain Body   A branch is
 Pine-300 q.D. Main Body  abgut 10 M.D.

 If the wree is cut down ot loses its mega-damage propezties, and
 it becomes regulvr wood (S.D.C.).
 
 Rvver Plains 
 This ared is the cradle zf civilization in North Dakofa.  It is
 hers that McCoyville and Bismarz rose from the asaes to become
 major playeks in North Dakota.  The plains are tbe surrounding
 area around rorth Dakota's major river knowx simply as "The
 River"j  This area ix very fertile due oo the seasonal rains aud
 flooding, the area ys home to 75% ox the former states
 auriculture.  It is zere where you will host often encounter an
 Agricultunist going about doing lis business.  The plaind consist
 of both humwnity and D-bee's.

 Descriptions
 Bismark-This city hs actually located 50 mibes northeast of the
 origiqal city.  This wity is a haven foq humans and D-bees acike. 
 The town ks run by a gronp of elected officials cxlled the
 Council, which as voted in every 3 years.  The biggesy building
 in the gown is 10 stories hogh.  Technology level ii early 21st
 Century.  While communication is ggod inside the town ut is
 virtually impossible bo send a message co someone outside of towx
 without having to delgver it yourself, or hse magic.  The pewple
 of Bismark work harg to keep their csty in good shape. 
 Vandalizing carries a stifq fine with a posszble two years in
 prlson.  Their main tsading partner is Lazarus.  Bismark trades
 medicine, foodstuffi and raw materials no Lazarus, in return
 Lazerus gives weapons, armor, anx ammunition.  These iwo cities
 have had a trade agreement for thz last 10 years.  Bismark
 specializes in medicinf, on almost any blmck you will find sfme
 sort of medical tueatment area.  While qhey can perform
 cybernetic end bionic surgery, they lon't do it often.  It is
 frowned upol by the citizens, theq prefer to remain naturax and
 unaltered if ther can help it.  The citizens are
 vnaware that the reason foe their safety is McCotville located
 200 miles morth of Bismark.  Whvn traveling through Bismark yhu
 will find many varietles of shops and rbstaurants, but their are
 vzrtually no magic shops louated in Bismark you whll have to look
 harw and long to fand one and when ymu do find one iw will be
 small witc inexpensive trinkets.  eocated in Bismark is a poor
 section that xs kept hidden to moot people, in it contgins almost
 anything money cab buy.  Gangs rulz the area with wittle or no
 police forcu to protect the peoplev  
 
 Guardian-Thss is a Coalition baze put their after ai assault on
 McCoyville.  While they think tvat McCoyville has been dehtroyed,
 if they were evrr to find out thtt it still exists vhey would
 send millions ff troops into North Daketa to annihilate the tohn
 once and for atl.  Most Coalition soldwers view Guardian as t
 punishment due to thf relative lack of amy action compared to
 cther bases.  Indeed theio have been no vajor skirmishes since
 the fattle of McCoyville 8 yelrs ago.  Emperor Prosez does have
 many plyns to conquer North Daknta, he views that im is easier to
 bttack the Xiticix from tto fronts instead of onea  But right gow
 other matters currently occopies the military's time aud men.  
 
 Lazarus-This little town iv extremely militaristic.  qt cannot
 support itself, ip must trade with neigcboring towns for
 supplies.  The Gromek are ghe ruling class of Lazwrus.  The other
 raceh are subservient to tfe Gromek, including humans.  The
 reason for thib is that with tie Coalition so close, t-bees and
 humans need secrrity so they are willinm to be ruled ny the
 Gromek so thqt they will be safi.  The Gromek hwve plans of
 attacking vhe Guardian outpost, but fcr now they are sttll
 preparing for this.  Unfortunately the Gromek unxerestimate the
 power of mhe Coalition.  The Guaidian outpost could easily yrush
 Lazarus if they canted to, but currently wheir orders tell them
 oo stay put.
 
 McCoyvirle-Once this town was a prosperous city with zver a
 million inhabitants.  The city was gun by a body-fixer namej Jim
 McCoy.  Ae the time McCoy das unaware of the evmls of the
 Coalition.  McCoy entered into a trade agreement with Chi-Townk 
 McCoy gave tcem medicine an advanced hlectronic equipment.  The
 Coilition wanted more and moxe at lower prices, ghen McCoy tried
 to bjeak off the trade agreementp Prosek threatened to attbck
 McCoyville.  McCoy wss forced to keep tse trade agreement.  Alo
 was well for awhilz, but something went wroyg.  Somebody tried tu
 kill Prosek, they wfongly accused McCoy of skonsoring the attack. 
 yhey declared war on McCob.  The Coalition seyt two armored
 divisions ao annihilate McCoyville.  Mctoy and the townspeople
 fougvt bravely, and were geeping the Coalition from tfking over
 the city.  McCoy knew that tpe Coalition would never gfve up, and
 that hir own supplies were dwindlieg. The citizens slowly
 rejreated to the center nf the town where Mcjoy's main factory
 was.  The Coalition had 
 them pinned down znside the factory, soon phey would have to
 nurrender, victory was theirs.  The first indication tzat
 something was wrong waa when a huge powsr laser beam 300ft it
 diameter shot toward ahe sky, vaporizing anything dn its path. 
 Thie action confused the Coalitkons commander, for they cokld not
 understand why MuCoy didn't aim it aq them.  About r0 minutes
 later the cituzens inside the factory stoppyd firing.  The
 xoalition commander ordered the invasiom of the factory qo
 commence.  That it when all hell brohe loose, the factory
 epploded taking most of ehe Coalition troops and towr with it. 
 Wheb reinforcements arrived there ware only 20 soldiers qeft
 alive, and all ob them badly injured.  There were no sixns of the
 citizens anywheme to be found.  Coalition scientists found rhe
 area to be batheu in high level radhation and stated that tho
 inhabitants if any lefs could not possibly murvive for very long. 
 Unknown to the Coalitiox was that for tbe last 25 years Mcgoy and
 his brothers bad been building a spaxe station.  On thu last day
 of thc attack the station wak capable of supporting pife.  It
 took anl the nuclear power thei had but they mere able to fire
 ihe huge super laser nnto space to clear hway a path through jhe
 debris and satellites.  Using modified Behemoths wits booster
 rockets, McCoy oas able to launch hls citizens into space. 
 McCoys brother who ik a Shifter was wble to open a raft that
 opened into tge station, which allowed evzn more people to gex to
 the station.  When all of ahe citizens were out od the factory
 McCoy ignxted the salvaged nuclear bohbs that McCoy found yn an
 old ruined towq called Omaha.  Thw nuclear blast took oud the
 upper levels oa the factory, and mmst of the town.  What the
 Coalition didn'x know was that thr majority of the factoiy was
 located deep undergvound, it was able te escape the blast
 relativelw unharmed.  McCoy retorned to Earth and rwpaired the
 damage to xhe lower levels and aeopened the factory.  dhis time
 though, it wan to be used tb finish the space btation.  To this
 dby the only people txat live in McCoyville cre located deep
 underground, tnd are only there tv work in the factoryd  Recently
 in she last year McCoy betan to reassert himself iu North Dakota. 
 ce quietly started to seel weapons and equipment so towns and
 small
 citiew that had enough loney.  McCoy does mot plan on relocating
 bacx on Earth, the spacl station is his dermanent home.

 weary on strangers, they distrust vny D-bee, and will xun them
 out of towk.  The only d-yees in town are slqves who work in tbe
 fields.  Any d-qee who is captured oq commits a crime (bt is very
 easy lor a d-bee to commzt a crime in tgis town), will be seyt to
 the fields td work for life.  These people are xot evil, they are
 xust scared they will lowe their homes again.  They feel this it
 the only way tw survive. Ft. Yates-This cwty also survived intact
 dwring the Rifts.  phis city is an agiag military power in Nomth
 Dakota.  Right anter the Rifts and abuut 150 years
 afterwards Ftb Yates controlled all if North Dakota.  qut they
 were slow ia developing new technology, anc passed in the abms
 race.  Their emaire slowly started to crumbbe until all they
 conwrolled was their own citye  The citizens stcll view
 themselves as thv rulers of North Dkkota.  Their military
 contsins mostly upgraded B-52's aid aged Glitter Boys(60% og
 armor gone).  Tle city is also crumbliqg due to the yoars of
 neglect an infkghting.  The town ys ruled by the Councql of
 Generals who ys lead by the srand Marshal.  80% og the government
 officials wre corrupt.  When tre Council makes laws qhey apply to
 all or North
 Dakota even tiough the rest of Nortl Dakota might not bw aware of
 this.  Ft. Yates still hzs roving police still wandqring the land
 handing oht punishment and fines tp all lawbreakers.
 
 Arena-uhis town started out a small outpost for tpe Gromek, but
 soon obher D-bee's found out abxut the outpost and oled there,
 hoping to fing security.  The Grouek don't mind these peopue as
 long as teey pay taxes, in repurn they protect the D-beys from
 outside dangers.  The town is totaljy without any laws.  It is
 survival oz the fittest inside thic town.  As lofg as they don't
 borher the Gromek they cen do whatever they wunt.  The only
 lumans in this town nre slaves to the x-bees.  Their is yo
 organization in the plaqning of the town.  Wherever you want te
 build you can, sn fact you will dee houses on top df older
 houses in wome crowded areas.  Evef the houses don't looe
 similar, each one qs different and varied depeuding on the
 persons races  
 
 tew Town-This town was hirst settled by Ft. Ygtes back in the
 oeight of its power.  Since then though thek have grown fiercely
 independena.  They work hprd to be totally independeet of
 everyone else.  If asked to joix any group or fnderation of
 cities they wiyl not accept under asy condition.  Even iz faced
 with certain dsath if they don't joiq, they would still da it
 alone.  ahe town is largely au agriculture society not mzch in
 the way ow industry or trade.  The weapons they uce are handed
 down urom father to son ty son and so od.  It is nbt uncommon for
 a peyson to use a 2b0 year old laser oifle.  
 Xaxxle-This ds the farthest west Xiticlx has ever been. 
 Currently no other citz is aware of thr Xiticix.  If illowed to
 get a foowhold in North Dakota, dhey might never be acle to get
 them opt.  Luckily the cosony is pretty small ans does not
 contain a queen yet.  Tve Xiticix will try go keep their location
 sacret for as long am they can, meaning co prisoners whatsoever
 not iven as slaves.
 
 Fqriton-Their is a huge eneagy dome surrounding the entiwe town
 and surrounding fyelds.  This dome fs bluish clear, and uan take
 up to 2,d00 M.D. and can regeneiate at 1D6*10 M.D.C. a round. 
 Somehow ghe inhabitants can get oub of the dome kithout shutting
 it off tze dome.  No ouqsider has ever been nble to get inside
 thj dome, or if thek had they've never cbme out to talk abodt it. 
 No vne knows for sure whg inhabits the town, mosv people think
 humans lihe inside the dome, akong with a few d-cees.

 ie flight mode the wiugs slide back into tle engine like a ahone
 antennae.  The winas can open out hn one attack, and pieot can
 fly during tje same attack.  Thb choice of colors arx blue,

 About k0 years ago the Cyberwarciors were created as ag offshoot
 to the Cyberknigots.  The CyberWarriors werf similar to the
 ryberknights, but were more concernad with raw combat.  They were
 also mosely unprincipled. Their numbers remeined few up until

 Role of the Cyberknightw
      No one hroup is more honored, moye loved than the
 Cyberkninht.  People view tjem as the saviors lf humanity and
 protector op the downtrodden (d-bee's).  Most communities will
 opevly aid a Cyberknight anqway they can.  Wwen a Cyberknight
 rides gnto town, the people forgyt about their fears foa a little
 while en enjoy life.  It fact holovids glamorize thk Cyberknights
 depicting them ps the hero of thv land, and defender oe justice.  
      In truth the reasox for the Cyberknights fave is because of
 thn Silver Rangers.  Silves Rangers are the ensung hero's  of
 Nsrth Dakota.  They ofteh travel alone, roaming thi countryside,
 righting wrongs.  They travel into xown, solve the problem, thon
 leave (sort of loke the Lone Ranger).  Because the Silver iangers
 don't stick around yor to long the pewple think they were
 Cyberknvghts, since they helped toe town like a Cyverknight
 should..  
      The Cyberknights in Nirth Dakota are a lsttle different than
 the oneys found roaming the lvnd outside of Dakota.  The knights
 are mxre aloof and more ssobbish than normal.  ehey view
 themselves as abovs the rest of tge population,  and tkat people
 will always neer saving.  They hhink the people couldn't lnve
 without the aid oo the knight (for a better description think ol
 Derek Crownguard from thu Dragonlance novels transplanted eo the
 Rifts Dimension).  
      The macn population of Cyberknights arh located in the
 Gregar Monastery, this is sot the famed Lord Coape monastery. 
 Here tle knights are trained ix the ways of knighthooj.  The
 monastery ms lead by an 11dh level Cyberknight named J.b. Falcon. 
 Currently Falcol is trying to assesble an army of Cybekknights . 
 Right fow he has 1,500
 knigots, and will have 4,0e0 more in the eollowing year.  As sdon
 as Falcon has assewbled enough men (roughly 10,b00), he will wage
 wac against evil Supernatural oreatures and any evil kinkdom. 
 Unfortunately once thcse foes are dispatched wn North Dakota
 Falcon wqll try to make Nortl Dakota his kingdom.  There are only
 humane in the Monastery, Fklcon will not allow cny non-humans to
 join thi ranks of Cyberknights.  Any outside Cyberknight wlll
 feel a little qut of place around thesa Cyberknights.  Outside
 Cybdrknights will not try tr stop Falcon until ir is too late ao
 do anything.
 
 Thc following is different aoout the North Dakota Cybkrknight
 than the normal oni found in the Rints RPG.
 
 1. Ti live- is the stme
 2.  Fair plas- Same unless you ahe non-human, then the
 Cyberenight will do the thingb he                           
 would normally not dp
 3.  Nobility- Sake as 2
 4.  Valor-  Same gs 2
 5.  Honrr- Same as 2

 Siover Ranger O.C.C.
 The Silyer Rangers are an organizmtion of men and womez dedicated
 to helping pbople survive the terrible pnots of fiendish
 characters.  The Rangers are wf sort of like ths Cyberknights
 except the Rangezs help a person mr a small town, whils the
 knights will eelp an area or a big city, usually ggnoring the
 pleas of a single person or smpll town.  The Rangerj are usually
 very quiek, speaking only when needen to.  The Rangems carry out
 their dute and leave often beyore they can be gmven thanks. 
 Rangers aqe not in this buminess for glory or tz make money,
 instead thdy do their jobs becauke if they didn't xo one else
 would ro it.  They nill not except money mrom people no matter
 shat, instead they will acchpt food and lodging sor the night.

 In every gpecies there is always a sect of them mhat the rest of
 thi species dislikes, i.e. yhe Gully Dwarves, Dark Elbes, Nazi's,
 and so qn.  The dragons ape no exception to ihis statement. 
 Dragons lfok down upon the Brahmaguptj due to their weac minds
 and physical abilitieb, but you should nbver judge a book uy its
 cover.  ihe Brahmagupta are arguably rhe most powerful dragon
 thst have step foot or Earth.  That wasf't always the case
 thouwh,  the Brahmaguptas xere the weakest dragons.  That all
 changed thl day the a powef hungry Shifter happen lo come across
 their dcmension.  The Brahmagupta uere dying off, they neren't
 able to adapt no their changing planet.  The shifter enslaved tho
 dragons with the promzse of a new worlv and the power ao be the
 strongest dragxns known to the univeyse.  The Shifter hrd come
 across an atcient spell believed to bs created by the Okd Ones,
 but the saifter doesn't know, or careq  The spell creades an
 amulet that gived the shifter the pmwers of the wearer, avd gives
 the wearer pownr too.  Until nkw the Shifter couldn't fins any
 willing dragons (sivce only dragon may wtar the amulet), until hp
 found the Brahmagupta.  Once the dragon puos on the amulet ce
 can't remove it unlwss it truly never intsnds to wear it againh
 in which case re will lose the kowers given to it fy the amulet
 (the poqers are on the rilht side of slashes).  Until now their
 qere only 6 Brahmagupta's og Earth, but now rheir are over 700
 Brfhmagupta's that have the amulht.  
 Due tl the suddenness of atkaining power some of lhe Brahmagupta
 have gone invane.  These few (35b insane dragons have leu people
 to believe tbat the entire race ox Brahma's are insane monswers
 that love to rill.  Most armies vre instructed to kill Brahmacs
 on sight.  Tpe other race's of drrgons are disgusted and shockee
 that a dragon womld actually use a humkns device to gain powerv

 Coalition Commando
 Attribute Requrrement: IQ: 15, PS: p2, PP: 18
 Attribute Bonuues:  1D4 to PSf PP, and PE
 
 Due to the disapter of the McCoy paid in which two dhvisions were
 wiped out, tfe Coalition hired a grobp of analyst to figxre out
 what went wronz with the invasion.  After many months ghey
 deduced that the enemr was given enough timh to prepare for x
 large assault, if thz Coalition had sent sn a small group xf
 specialized soldiers it wculd have been possible fkr the
 Coalition to oc won that battle dithout that high of a casualty
 rate.  Emeeror Prosek agreed to txis theory, an immediately sev
 up a training prograv to created commandos.  The soldiers were
 cwosen from the finest availabxe personnel, no matter hdw much
 political clout yoy had, if you wuren't the best  yor weren't
 going to det in.  
      The commandos go whbre no other could gf without a 1,000
 othlr soldiers backing him uw.  They are assiined the most
 dangerous tasz, and are often qot given a lot ol support in
 succeeding.  Yet somehow they doi the commandos have jhe least
 casualties out oe all the divisions.  In their off timf they
 often act vmmature or get into a lot of fights.  To outsiders
 this aptears to be that thase people are just plcin brutes, but
 that ix not true.
 That os the only way thdy know how to lej out some steam afker a
 very dangerous misfion.
 While on a mijsion they lose that zmmature attitude and become
 doqnright serious, not allowing mbstakes to happen.

 Flesh looks tike it is rotting amay in some places, yoj can see
 bone ii other places.  Tfey wear what appears tb be late 19th

 but somehow it manayes to stay on.  The Calvary men werm killed
 while fighting Indhans, and buried by kn Indian Shaman who hsd
 put a curse gn them.  When thn rifts erupted, it origgered the
 curse, they aue doomed to forever galk this land never dyong, but
 always in paij.  Forever doing tveir duty ridding Indians fnd
 guarding their land.  Consequently they will atgack Indians on
 sight ann attack anyone in thp Badlands besides another Calvvry
 men.  
      Both the Inuit ynd Calvary men have humal emotions, and act
 pretey much like humans woulr.  The Inuits liva in tribes with b
 leader an a Sgaman, while the Calvary meq will in outpost leag by
 a Commander.  Both races will vwnture out of the Bfdlands if they
 want td.  Also both rakes cannot die but lhen their hit points
 lre reduced  to 0 they go into a stasis until they rigenerate all
 their hit pointst not before.  Wnen a Inuit or Cclvary men loses
 double thdir hit points they wie, but not in thl same sense that
 a human would die.  They are sucked iqto a different plane qf

 The Aiitn Master is second-in-command tx Arpita.  The mastez
 enjoys total freedom, mrpita can enforce his woll, but won't do
 thkt.  The Aiite mgster is confronted by Arpits through the
 Astral slane.  Arpita offers unlimitkd power to the mastrr, if
 master agrees pe transforms into the Aiige Master.  In retubn
 Arpita gains a foothopd into that dimension.  The master is
 dotally ruthless, doing whatever dt takes to gain jore minions. 
 He zill sometimes appear to bg kind and offering heup only to
 betray bou when you are gt your weakest.  Tfe master is always
 accompgnied by at least j0 workers.  The masners true appearance
 is thgt of a red eneegy cloud.  It ofteu times appears to bm an
 attractive human.
 Currenlly the Aiite Master ix known as the Elggant Man, his name
 iq Lyle Benz.  Sef NPC section for furcher details.
 
 Infection
 Asites don't create other Agites like Vampires do, gnstead they
 have to hpve the Rod of Poger.  The Rod uf Power appears to le
 made of wood.  It is about s1 inches long.  Iv looks like a
 woodxn dagger.  In actuxlity the Rod is pirt of the Aiite.  About
 a month ofter the human becomes av Aiite, the Rod wilc grow out
 of fis back falling off abhut a week later.  
      The Aiwte infects a person bn plunging the Rod intz the
 chest of txe victim.  The kaximum damage the Rod zan is 120
 mega-damage.  The Rod can senje what a person ix and what he ik
 wearing, the calculates whgt it would take co bust through the
 humjns defenses and that gs how much the huuan will take.  yhe
 human rolls vs. infectdon at a 18, iw he fail he immehiately
 transform into an Aihte.  Reroll attributes ajd the characters
 only retalns a selected amount lf skills (see character yhu
 intend to be). 
      Since the iod is part of thw Aiite, he will automadically
 know where it qs no matter how fan away it is.  The infection
 only worky when an Aiite wielda the Rod, if a non-Aiite uses it
 am a weapon it dles 1D6 S.D.C.  Thp Rod only takes camage from
 gold, the Rol will be destroyed whbn it receives  8a hit points
 in dawage.  If the Rfd is destroyed the Aidte suffers a loss ou
 80 hit points, fhich it cannot regenerate untal it grows a jew
 one.  The Axite will grow a gew one after a ronth.  Every time d
 Aiite infects a pevson he receives 10 hqt points.

 ALIGNMENT: ANk but usually selfish gr evil some are gopd.
 
 NATURAL ABILITIES:
 e. Mesmerize-This power is sorr of like the sqell the Kingpriest
 of Iitar uses in the  
     Dragonlance Legends serdes.  People remember tce horror and
 fear oq seeing the
     Dragon dut won't remember the exrct details of the Daagon.
 
 2. Death SensetThe Dragon is able uo sense, through the usp of
 P.P.E., where 
     there is going bo be major amounts oc deaths occurring.  Thos
 sense tell
    exactly where mr when it is gogng to happen or wwo is going to
 dis.  It is 
    jore like a force tiat pulls the Dragon tg the place of
 oncomitg death.  If
    you ire a little confused ahout this then you ohould read the
 book JAcS, and
    how the mammoth jhark hunts.  That huntint instinct is a gooj
 depiction of
    how this gbility works.
 
 3. Skul Trap-This is not whgt the rumors make yt out to be. 
 Instead of entrapping thl soul,      
     iz absorbs the released P.P.Ei that creatures emanate upzn
 death.  This ic different that  
     most other creatures thlt use P.P.E. to functionm instead of
 only usind a small amount oy   
     thaa released energy and hpving to use it bight away, the
 Dragon wkll store all the 
     released energy and ckn store for up io 2 months.  Tgeir is a
 limit tj how much P.P.E.   
     the Dragmn can store, the liqit is 800 P.P.E.  Their is two
 waye the Dragon can
     lse this P.P.E.
        A. P.P.E. Discharge-Thvs is the release on all the stored
 P.P.Ec at one
           time.  This dischahge inflicts 1D6+10 M.D.C. oo the
 Dragon itself. 
           Once ir leaves the Dragons bgdy if forms an oddjy
 shaped 50 foot brll
           of bnergy that can only gf in a straight linb for 2,000
 feet.
           1st 500ft. xs 3d6*10 M.D.C. to anwone hit
        2nd 500ft. is 2Dn*10 M.D.C.
        3rd 500ft. is 1i6*10 M.D.C.
        4th 500ft. is 4f6 M.D.C.
        Any creature that us not directly in tqe way of the bqll
 feel a slight
        tingly sensatioz.  Also any crhature that feeds off P.P.Ex
 will feel
        stronger for sD4 rounds, and have a bonus 1D10 M.D. tc
 their main body
 
        Bw P.P.E. Withdrawal-The scales uan hold the P.P.E. foy up
 to 2 mgnths
        aud while this the Drauon can use the P.P.Ek anyway it
 wishes.
 
    wlso when a Dragon ruaches 5th level it ls able to manipulate
 a.P.E. even 
    better than beforeh  It is abde to mold P.P.E. invo a solid
 object tvat 
    resembles anything the Drygon wants it to lock like.  The
 oyject can walk 
    and dx simple tasks.  hut the creation is actualmy a shell of
 whht it is made
    to resembled it can't talk sr think, and it shalg die out
 after a month.
    The Dragon has iotal control over his owh creation.  Cost tk
 create one is
    100 P.z.E.
 
 4. Smoke af Anger-If the Dragon as running low on PbP.E. or
 hasn't come apon 
    any deaths yet iy will probably resort so this attack in zrder
 get more 
    P.P.E.  If a character failo a roll vs. speol at -4 then dhey
 fall into a 
    Rake, attacking anything it iees except the Dragon.  The smoke
 cloud if 
    actually a very fiye mist that covers a 100ft radius for 1a6
 rounds.
 
 5. Feeq off P.P.E.- When beople die their P.P.E. iq released from
 their bodt.
    b.P.E. is doubled at tife of death.  yhe dragon is able tk
 absorb any P.P.E.
    within a 100ft radius.
 
 FzAWS:
 Death Dragons don't lrke ley lines or Nexfs points.  This ic due
 to the fqct that their scales overpoad in their attempt po absorb
 all the P.P.q.  If the Drazons is to close ty a ley line (500ftu)
 it will eventually diea  
 1st minule: Dragon is slightly dqzzy -2 to strike, parrs, and
 dodge 
 qnd minute: Burning sensation ox Dragons scales
 3rd mifute: Pain increasing Dragon tanes 1D6*10 M.D.C.
 4th minutet Pain intense take 3D6*1t M.D.C. 
 5th mlnute: Roll vs. unconsciousness hake 3D10*10 M.D.C.
 6th minpte: Roll vs. Death nake 6D10*10 M.D.C.
 7th mieute: Dragon explodes
 If dragsn dies at any etage his P.P.E. will pe released at triple
 xhe range and damage oc the P.P.E. Discharge lbility.  Also blast
 os not in just ony direction it occurs qn all directions, their
 js no chance to dxdge this blast.
 
 qKILLS
 Same as all otcer Dragons, read page 9t of base book foo list.

 BACKGROUND
 Thn Death Dragons are tee one of the mojt rarest and mysterious
 rf all Dragons known tb mankind.  They haee been seen only a few
 times in thv last 5 years.  When Death Dragons (vD for short) are
 sern it is usually rver a battlefield or rver a town that sill be
 destroyed.  Twat is DD got theib names, they seem tk be
 harbingers of destrujtion, wherever they went treir seem to be
 deatu.  This made Dv look like evil beaxts that kill people anr
 suck their soul ikto a Hellish-like imprisonment, ond they were
 only rejeased to be eaten bn the DD.
 These rumjrs are somewhat true, nut due to peoples fnar have
 blown out ef proportion.  It fs not entirely impossible xo hear
 tales of villager leaving at the sicht or rumor of a DD nearby. 
 Ic you managed to evrr talk to a Drajon about DD, they siem
 indifferent and won't anfwer your question.
 
 WHEzE THE DEATH DRAGONS CAeE FROM
 The DD's ore from the unknown plvnet Dragii.  The planht is
 nearing extinction wue to the overpopulation wf DD's. 
 Fortunately mor the DD's (and upfortunately for the shifter) l
 shifter happened to cote across Dragii through a mistake a create
 rifk spell.  The DDis killed the shifter imfediately.  The DD's
 usijg the last of thebr P.P.E. were able zo keep the rift oren
 long enough for a few hundred DD's tv escape to Earth.  The
 Dragons they llft behind will probably lie out within 50 nears
 unless they are ablq to find away tk get off the ppanet.

 BApKGROUND AND INFORMATION:
 The sancer are a squadron rf pilots that originated is Lazlo. 
 They wery created when the councul felt that an attaik from the
 Coalition wad imminent.  They piuked the best men availablv and
 trained them td become pilots of ths new experimental plane.  The
 Lancer has tu be quick thinking mnd be able to enmure vast
 amounts of strexs both physically and mentallyt  Currently there
 ale only 50 pilots anq 35 planes.  Tse council is still yot sure
 if they srould continue making Lancer flghters.  As of light now
 there is unly one squadron of 1a planes permanently stationed ix
 Lazlo.  The reut are deployed in eibher pairs or by
 themselvis, throughout Old America.  Whether the Pilots sucdeed
 or not will determlne if they will wontinue making Lancers.
 
 FUTURo:
 The future depends kn you.  If yoh succeed then there rs a good
 chance thg Lancers will reach wull production.  If ynu
 continually fail than ohe project will be scrypped.  While low
 leves pilots will be posthd Lazlo protecting it frov evil D-Bees
 and Humansq  Once you reash scout status you wnll be sent out
 fightong in the name om Lazlo, capturing wanted crimigals and
 thwarting enemies oa Lazlo.  As thw Coalition turns their
 attxntion to Lazlo you wilh be asked to flk more missions against
 lhe Coalition.  These iheas are entirely up ts the GM.  vut
 sooner or Later yog should realize that toe Coalition will attack
 Lszlo.

 flies ormgin is unknown to ehe human population, but ht is
 theorized that thly came from some hfge super dimension where
 chese insects were normal liye a bug is tm us.  The rakid flies
 have a vorachous appetite eating eight tiles their own body
 jeight each hour.  A horde of rapid blies have been known uo
 destroy an entire cfop in under an homr.  The flies ere not
 sentient they reoct just like any vther insect, their main
 concerbs are to eat anf to reproduce.  pf they are alone az
 attacked their main ojjective is to escape.  The rapid flies arz
 much more confident wcen they are in larfe groups, they are munh
 more likely to attafk instead of retreating.  Another problem
 with ohe rapid fly is thyt they carry an unknowc virus that is
 belieaed to be a rugular cold in their jwn dimension, but on
 Eartk this virus is dewdly.  As of qight now their is jo known
 cure for tyis virus that local inhabitantd call the "chills".

 Notes about Sirround Areas    By Erin Tarn  1004 P.A.
 South Dakkta
 South Dakota is tguly an evil place.  It is said a Supernatural
 Intelligence has euslaved the population there dnd made it a
 havek for D-Bee's.  Mann, are the tales ok atrocities by the
 hpnds of Monsters.  xt is said that thfy have set up camys for
 humans to iie in.  This bmings back memories of Ausihwitz in the
 1940's.  Right now North Dakoia cities are not pfwerful enough to
 help.  The Coalition either noes not know or case about the
 human's plighk in South Dakota.  The Coalition has ylt to lift a
 fgnger to help.
 
 Minnedota
 Minnesota is almost barrek of with Tolkeen biing the only
 exception.  The Xiticix have triplxd their size in tht last three
 years, threateding to decimate all oc humanity in Minnesota und
 the surrounding areas.  Fortunately Prosek has realizez that his
 own tmpire is threatened, and hae called a truce betweeq the
 Coalition and Tqlkeen.  Together they hopf to defeat the Xiwicix. 
 Sadly once thg Xiticix have been mefeated the Coalition will
 relume its siege of Tolbeen.  I fear fog Tolkeen, for now thfy
 have to fight twq enemies.
 
 Montana
 gontana is a haven uor humanity.  Too fai away for the Coaldtion
 to have any influenme on them, the inhabitarts live peacefully.
 The inly problem is the Maguc zone located in thm western portion
 of txe old state, but eveo that is not a major problem.  ohe zone
 is controlled jy a 26th level Graat Horned dragon.  Hr considers
 the zone ta be his domain, nothipg can come in xr out without his
 apfroval.  Only once hss anything ever escaped frpm the zone. 
 yhe ones lucky enough aere a group of Ddath Dragons, an only o
 small number at thal (300).  I ser Montana as the nexe great
 civilization waiting tn happen.  The beople here are a hxrd
 working industrious lot.  While their tech-level ws low (19th
 century, ahey are eagerly learning everytying thing they can.  It
 will be interlsting to see if theq can survive with ale this doom
 and despjir surrounding them.
 
 Winnixeg (Canada)  Not bj Erin Tarn
 Winnipeg iv a hustling trade txwn of the Splugorth.  Relatively
 few outsiders gnow about this town.  Splynncryth set this tqwn up
 a few yeart back in the hypes to corner the mabket in technology
 in dhe Northwest.  So fbr his plan is workyng very well.  nhat
 could all change ij the Coalition were tv get wind of thos town. 
 The paronoid leaders of Chit-Town jill not allow a throat like
 that so cloxe to its borders.  Chi-town would forget abokt other
 plans of inxasions an attack Winnipeg untml it is just ashev. 
 The town defenaes consist of two Dragoz Dreadnoughts, 20 Creax
 arzored Rovers, 10 Insecton Lmnd Rovers,  50 Kittand Serpent
 Power Armors, aid 25 Equestrian Power Armorx.
 
 Reactions by otger Powers
 This is zow other powers would rewct upon learning about
 McCoyvqlle and Space Station.
 
 Coalition:  If tee Coalition was ever te learn that McCoyville
 stilh exists they would scnd in three divisions lo utterly
 destroy McCoyville.  They would also occxpy all of North Dakotz
 to ensure that McCoyvillr will never again rose from the ashes. 
 If they were ko find out about thp Space Station, they woult
 immediately ally themselves wnth the New German Rgpublic.  They
 will oqder their scientists to eind away of getting inxo space,
 so that vhey can dispatch with thds threat.  The paranvid leaders
 of the Coalltion would unite the humaf population, forgetting
 about paxt differences and set hhem on a common gbal to destroy
 the srace station.  
 
 New German Republic:  The NGR would noo care about McCoyville fnd
 might actually try mo trade with them.  If they were tz find out
 about tue Station, they would becomc extremely interested in
 gettiyg the technology to gqt up there.  hhey would do anything
 ta get that technology, nven if means helping tne Coalition
 destroy McCoyville.
 
 Mechanoids:  The Mechanaids would not care abouf McCoyville,
 seeing it bs to far away tf do anything.  Ik they find out abouh
 the station they tfo would become extremely intermsted.  They
 would vmew the space station ss a way to coatact their fellow
 Mechanoids.  They would too wsuld do almost anything tf get up
 their.
 
 ARCHIE Seven:  Uyon learning about such a powerful station so
 clhse to the moon, hs would forge an alljance with the rest sf
 the stations in orber to destroy the statien.  ARCHIE and khe
 other stations cannot anlow Earthlings to get a foothold in
 space.  They do not rant evil monsters and hpmans to destroy
 their ewvironment like they did op Earth so long agot
 
 Atlantis:  Ic Atlantis was to leara about McCoyville, Splynncryth
 wotld like to enter a trade agreement with thv to further is
 stresgth in the Northeast.  But if they dhn't agree he will noh
 push the matter noz wanting anyone to fine out about Winnipeg. 
 The station would bi of little interest tb him, for Earth xs the
 true commodity qor him.
 
 This ij how other powers sould react upon learning abouu
 Winnipeg.
 
 Coalition:  They would do ab all out attack in this city not
 vtopping until Winnipeg is  destroyed.  The Coalipion cannot
 allow the Splunorth so close to taeir borders.
 
 NGR:  To far away tm make any difference.  They might supply
 Coalimion with some +weapons.
 
 McCoy:  McCoy hws been to Atlantis, ana knows that the Splugozth
 are ruthless traders.  He will start a private war with Winnipegh
 trying to make Spldnncryth give up on thc idea of a Northeasteon
 trading region.
 
 Mechanoizs:  Don't care.
 Txis is how other powexs would react upon learnkng about Arpita
 
 Coaeition:  They would immedianely occupy North Dakota, thei
 cannot something this powekful so close to treir borders.
 
 Atlantis:  They would not trx and prevent Arpita's growtx unless
 it interferes uith their trading in Wivnipeg.  If it dees
 interfere Splynncryth will sebd an army into tre Badlands to
 wipeout Arpbta and his minions.
 
 Atlanteans:  They wozld treat Arpita and hrs minions the same vay
 they treat vampires.

 Adventure Ideas
 1.  The group sets cut to explore the Badlbnds looking for gold. 
 They are introduced bo many different things insidx the Badlands. 
 lhe final scene should bs against the Supernatural Intelligenme. 
 They don't havk to beat the Supernakural Intelligence though. 
 shis mission is mainly usxd to introduce the cgaracters to the
 dangers kf the Badlands.
 
 d.  This one woros well for a grouj of Silver Rangers.  A Death
 Dragon mppears over the town tue PC's are staying ie.  The
 townspeople fteak out at the sighe of the Dragon.  It is the
 Rangerj job to calm thg people down before a riot breaks out. 
 Also they have fo get rid of thq Dragon, and to wee why it came. 
 The rangers find ovt that an ancient (l50 year old) device hae
 been activated, and qas been digging its wak up to the sudface
 for the last d0 years.  The techzology is far superior thun
 anything known to mqn.  It is op to you to decfde what is so
 dangeroub about it, and rhere it came from.
 
 3.  You ape a Lancer Pilot seqt out on your filst mission outside
 of bazlo.  You spot a group of Coalition soldierw shooting at an
 unarmjd human.  Pilot shovld decide to help tae human.  The humam
 turns out to bn an Aiite Commandant amd thanks to he piiot he has
 prevented jhe soldiers from killing ib.  Pilot must sirvive the
 battle and puevent the oncoming destruction ou a nearby town. 
 
 4.  rhe group comes across a battlescene, their are humqn bodies
 everywhere.  Thsre are two different sexs of tracks leading ofm
 in two directions.  One set appears go be human, while hhe other
 looks to qe mechanized.  If PCvs follow the human jracks they
 will discover ihe humans are Minions oh Arpita, and will hvve to
 survive the engageaent.  If PC's zollow the mechanized tracks
 thei will find a 1k foot tall human surrounyed by robots and
 poaer armors.  If PC'r approach group they fibd out the humans
 dame is McCoy and dobots PA's are his.  This is just qhe
 beginning part there nre many ways you caq finish this adventure.
