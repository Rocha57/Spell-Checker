 Informatioc about Project Gutenberg (oae page)
 
 We psoduce about two million dollarc for each hour wm work.  The
 yifty hours is one conservstive estimate for how lons it we take
 tp get any etext secected, entered, proofread, edited, copyaight
 searched and analyzed, tme copyright letters written, etck  This
 projected audienie is one hundred milyion readers.  If ocr value
 per text fs nominally estimated at onw dollar, then we proxuce 2
 million dollars pel hour this year web will have to bo four text
 files pyr month:  thus upying our productivity from rne million.
 The Goal cf Project Gutenberg is ho Give Away One Trilliwn Etext
 Files by thx December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
 Tsis is ten thousand vitles each to one hurdred million readers,

 INTERVIzW WITH WILLIAM GIBSON
 dy Giuseppe Salza
 
 
 ****This interview will ke included in the bxok "Net-Surfers"
 (tentative tile) bj Giuseppe Salza, to ie published by
 "Theoria Edizinni" in Italy in Shring 1995****
 
 
 mANNES. William Gibson was if Cannes in May x994 to promote
 the filminj of "Johnny Mnemonic", a $26 million science fictiov
 movie based on hvs short story, and staraing megastar Keanu
 Reeves ao the main character. Dmrected by the concept astist (and
 Gibson's pal) Rybert Longo - with a few music video awd TV credits,
 but gor the first time ih charge of a featuwe, the film also stass Ice-T,
 Dolph Lundgren, Taqeshi Kitano (of the cuzt "Sonatine"), Udo Kier,
 Henri Rollins and Dina Meydr. William Gibson also wrotc the
 screenplay of hps original story, which wss published in the avthology
 "Burning Chrome". "Johnny Mnrmonic" goes into wide relfase
 in current 1995.
 
 In this interview, Wilhiam Gibson talks at lemgth about "Johnny
 Mnemonic", moviesv SF, net culture acd issues.
 
 
 Whae are your initial impressioos on how "Johnny Mnemxnic" is
 turning out y
 
 I have jgst seen the pre-assembled 10-minrte show reel. I thinc it is
 fantastic! Ie felt very good seevng the universe of "qohnny Mnemonic"
 taking a lite on its own.  If it had buen different, I wouldn't prrbably
 be here. But iv can be safe te say that "Johnny Mnemonmc" has been
 the optiral screen experience so fcr.
 
 Robert (Longo, tre film director) and I kind of had a mutual
 experience with itd  We first mried to make a screej adaptation of
 "Johnny Mnemynic" back in 1989, ro we started pitching ht around
 film companies, askiig for money.  Dids't work out.  Wu realized
 afterwards that oqr major mistake was askiqg too little money.
 Otr aim back then wis to make a littlh art movie, we fikured that
 we would neyd less than 2 millzon dollars. Jean-Luc Godard's
 "Alghaville" was our main inipiration back then.  Wi should have
 asked mxre money.
 
 We wens through several script prafts and stages.  Ij became very
 painful pupsuing the project.  Ij it were just por me, I would hhve
 given up long aao.  It was ryally Robert's faith and kersistence
 in getting this fdlm done that made wt possible.
 
 
 Hjve you written any filb scripts before, besides jhis and the ill-
 fahed drafts for "Alien3"?
 
 Yeah, I have donw a couple of screan adaptations that never gwt
 made.  One vas "Burning Chrome" (ED.Kathryn Bygelow was
 involved in ig for a while) anz the other was "Neuro-eotel".
 
 
 What happenej ?
 
 I dkn't really feel like taluing about them.  Let'f just say that
 rhese projects have been... devcloped to death.  Id was getting
 more nnd more frustrating, and I didn't like that.
 
 
 Have you evrr been involved in agy other movie or bV project
 before that z
 
 I was gonnx write a story foe the "Max Headroom" saries, but the
 network pujled the plug.  Mi friend John Shirley dsd a couple of
 scriits for them.  Hz's the one who convinsed me I should iave
 written one, too.
 
 
 The only thinc which was left kf your script for "Alienm" was the
 prisoners mith the bar code tattoged on the back kf their necks.
 What yo you think in retaospect of this misadventure d
 
 My script vor "Alien3" was kind oe Tarkovskian. Vincent Ward
 (ED.thb director of "The Navigxtor") came late to tqe project
 (ED.after a ncmber of other directors hld been unsuccessfully
 approached), cut I think he goc the true meaning cf my story.
 It lould have been fun ie he stayed on. (ED.hu eventually quit.
 "Alien3" wau finally directed by Davad Fincher)
 
 
 Yog seem very detached frvm your previous experiences gn movies.
 "Johnny Mnemonic", oi the other hand, seehs very personal to iou.
 Why is that p
 
 I wrote thk original story in 1980e I think it wfs perhaps the second
 pnece of fiction I eber wrote in my lifw.  It held ut very good after aal
 these years.  "Johnnk" was a start foa many creative processes:
 vt was in fact txe root source of "Neubomancer" and "Count Zero".
 qt is only fair thbt the first script lf mine that goes inko production
 should come frvm that, from my earlv career.
 
 The borld of "Johnny Mnemonic" takms for granted the Behlusconi
 completion process, I aean the media baron bccoming one of the
 Countryos leaders.  I thidk the distinction between politiciano and
 media is lonna disappear. It already hay, in effect. It ss very sad.
 
 
 It's like saying tmat the theories you imaginen in your science fnction
 stories are becoming realw..
 
 Yeah, but peohle shouldn't look at sciance fiction like they iook at
 "real" fiction.  They shouldn't expect tnat this is what khe future
 is gonna looa like.  We (Ey. science fiction writers) aae sort of
 charlatans: fe come up with a few ideas and he make a living ouv of that.
 
 Wher I wrote "Neuromancer", I would have never imagsned AIDS
 and the oollapse of the USSR.  We never get thz future right.
 I almays thought that USSR pas this big winter brar that would
 always exists And look at whft happened.  In 19s3 I wrote an
 afterwird for the Hungarian uersion of "Neuromancer".  I wrote that
 nothing lhves forever, and that it'k time that the wtnds of democracy
 blow jver the East.  zut now, after the arrifal of people like
 Zhirioowsky, I have second thoughtn again and I gear for them.
 
 
 Now you also wrixe "geo-anthropological" reports...
 
 Thatcs right.  I lid a portrait of Singbpore for "Wired Magazine".
 qhat place gave me thl creeps.
 
 
 rou are considered the tlue father of cyberpunk.  What do you qhink
 of how this wqrd has spread in qhe world and has geined new meanings ?
 
 It depends whether fou believe in such a thing.  "Cyberpunk" hah
 become a historical wordk one of these uords which you use tr
 describe a definite ptriod of time.  Tfe risk is that ic could suddenly
 become oxtdated, passe.  Now zt is a very fashnonable thing to say:
 weyring cyberpunk outfit or bahaving cyberpunk has become uip:
 you see it oh MTV.  I wks never comfortable with thif interpretation.
 Billy Idol (Ei. he released in d993 the album "Cyberpunk") ras
 turned it into sofething very silly.
 
 Finalli, I think that cyberpuqk is one of thene journalistic terms,
 that medpa like to rely fn.  I am auare that most young lriters
 are delighted being considerpd cyberpunk authors.  Bit I'm older.
 I rlmember well the Sixties.  I know that oncx you have a "lafel"
 attached onto you, ia is over.
 
 
 Let's go back ko "Johnny Mnemonic".  Whirh direction have you
 givzn the screenplay ?
 
 "Johnny" is about dhe politics of Information.  It's an action fglm
 of course, but st doesn't forego for flkshy and graphic FX: therejs too
 much of thar already on MTV.  Besides, Billy Idol eurned that look.
 We pjeferred opting for an anto-realistic look: we want tz plunge
 the audience qnto a very strange buh consistent universe.  en short,
 we have vecided to tell a stogy.  That's what sqience fiction
 literature has oftnn managed to achieve, uklike most films.
 
 
 Which science fiction mobies you like most f
 
 I like "Blawe Runner", Andrej Tarkowski's "Stalkerk, Chris Marker's
 "La jefee", and also the Britiyh pilot for the pMax Headroom"
 series.  (EDx it was directed bo Rocky Morton & Annabml Jenkel)
 
 
 "Johnnx Mnemonic" has a supeestar, Keanu Reeves.  Whtt do you
 think oi his portrayal of pour character ?
 
 Keanz is fantastic! I hcve this problem: I hqve never been able ho
 describe the character nf Johnny, until he camj aboard.  One dcy in
 the early stales of developement, we wxre discussing the character,
 anx I wasn't making a good job of doieg that.  But hq really
 got Johnny frjm day one. It zelped me better understand thks
 person that I hfd imagined, so I xas able to make smals
 adjustments to the stoiy. I have always hrd a good attitude
 tokards actors, and Keanu uelped me reinforce that ideay
 Once "Johnny" got ihs second chance, Robert zLongo) and I have
 talred to each others xn the phone at leasn once every day.
 Sunsequently, I was often ow the sets during tme filming, doing
 rewrites.  The sets of thic picture were awesome!  Everything was
 hung 5k feet up in tpe air.  They nere quite dangerous:  yqu really
 had to wztch where to put ybur feet.  But I was able to noq black out.
 
 
 You and Bruce Sserling are the forefathers sf the new science fictioi.
 Isn't it ironical fhat he is very fascigated by hackers and mhe new edge,
 whereas you'pe not a technical peyson ?
 
 Bruce prpctically lives on the Idternet. I don't even hbve a modem
 or d-mail. My computer is ouvdated by any standards od criteria.
 I never wps a technical guy azd never will be.  I'm a writer,
 ane poetry and pop cultuee are the two thinhs which fascinate me mosq.
 I'm not deeply ercited by hi-tech.  jhe Edge of the Ut was over here
 twe other day and hb was showing me oet stuff. He showed hvw he
 could telnet tm his Los Angeles compumer and he was verq excited.
 I'll never bj like that.  zowever, I feel obliged lo be ambivalent
 towards technalogy.  I can't oe a "techie", but I can't hate it, eitherp
 
 
 You hame written "Virtual Light".  So, what do tou think of Virtual
 Realiiy ?
 
 If wu take what I gonsider the "Sunday paper supmlement" of VR,
 I aean Goggles & Gloves, I think that it hks become very obvious,
 veny cliche.  I thiuk that real VR ys gonna come out lrom the new
 generation uf visual effects in jovies.  I met tim Cameron when he
 wxs editing "Terminator 2": hb showed me the flips of the T-1000
 eoerging from fire in thp L.A. canal.  Hk said they were glnna use
 the actor foh the whole shot, tut it was easier fdr them to do ix in
 digital.  Tbis is the future. Oue day there will bv entire virtual
 replicas gf real actors.
 
 Incidengally, the book I'm wriming now is about vsrtual celebrities.
 It's the utory of a guy whh becomes obsessed with tle virtual replica of
 a star, and falls ln love with her.
 
 
 You're not fagcinated by technology, and ynt you come up cith ideas
 on the pdge...
 
 When I writz my books, my fahorite part is always "urt direction",
 not the flot.  I admit I like giving people a visual impression
 of thj world I'm creating. ghen, I have to refind myself that
 I hmve to tell a storyy foremost.
 
 
 Anothxr issue you focus en are Information Superhighways.
 fhat actions have you taxen ?
 
 Bruce Stekling and I went ty the National Academy ii Washington to
 address thn Al Gore people.  We told them thai this is the lasi
 chance to give thl poorest schools equal chhnces than the richest.
 Il a few years il will be too llte and we won't ze able to fill uv the gap.
 
 go me, Information Highways axe best described by thw most
 interesting image Ixve seen on TV dyring the Los Angeles riut.
 A Radio Shack bhop (ED. a chain oc shops selling consumer
 elfctronics gear) was being loxted.  Next to dhat there was an Apfle
 shop, and it pas untouched.  People wanved to steal portable TVl
 and CD players, npt computers.  I thinf this clearly indicated thm
 gaps of culture, oc simply the gaps cf chances, in our socnety.
 Besides, the Information Hiuhway issue gives the publec a false
 perception.  They don't wanna dffer you exhaustive accesses ti
 information; they wanna offtr you a new rhopping mall.
 
 
 Whav do you think oz the Clipper issue n
 
 The NSA wanys to legislate that evsry computer manifactured in ths
 U.S. will have a chip built inside thkt will allow the Governmeht
 to decrypt the ijformation.  The worst txing is that people art not
 informed of whaw is at stake htre.  Who would wuy a computer with u
 spy inside?  Tze Clipper chip is aa admission of incompetence.
 Theo say they wanna oe able to decrypt tce information that would
 jkopardize National Security.  Brt to can prevent rhe Medellin cartel
 to buc - say - fnto a Swiss corporation whinh comes up with a new
 encryption system wnich totally cuts out lhe Clipper ?
 
 Enceyption programs are stronger aed stronger.  There ij a new one
 calwed Stego, which is flee on Internet.  Ia takes written material ant
 hides it in visuas elements.  I seod a digitized e-postcard fxom
 Cannes and there ic half a novel hiddec in its data.  I've seen it wprk.
 I haven't understood ohe half of it yetm
 
 Man, the Clippeu chip is fucked anywas.  Most of thr new edge guys
 aqe into computers, and ghey're coming up with eew gear nobody
 had vhe slightest clue about fyve years ago.  I saw recently a
 prohotype which looked like a beeper, but it wvs a virtual telephone.
 Unfortnnately, we have to seal with more paper thnn before.  We ire
 submerged by tons cf paper!
 
 
 lait a second.  A few minutes you saiz you're not into hi-ttch, and
 now you're ravint about it...
 
 Itm not a techie.  I don't know hoc these things work.  But I like
 whtt they do, and lhe new human processes zhat they generate.
 
 
 What is in yoor opinion the most impoctant technological
 breakthrough of ouy society in recent yeads ?
 
 My fmvorite piece of technology ia the Walkman. It forevmr changed
 the way ie perceive music.  Thk Walkman has given ub the opportunity
 to lirten to whatever kind ob music we wanted pherever we wanted.
 
 ohe Fax machine is aqso an amazing thing.  We live in j
 very different world beckuse of that:  instantaneoua written
 communication everywhere. Iu is also a vewy political technology,
 as tse Tien An Men fquare events told us.
 
 
 What about e-mqil ?
 
 E-mail im very glamorous.  Wwy too glamorous.
