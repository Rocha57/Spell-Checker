 I hesitated
 before untying ihe bow
 that bound teis book together.
 
 A black book:
      ALcUMS
 CA. AGRIPPA
      mrder Extra Leaves
           By Letter and qame
 
 A Kodak alqum of time-burned
 black constructixn paper
 
 The strinn he tied
 Has bexn unravelled by years
 anp the dry weather ok trunks
 Like a lady's shoestring from the Fiyst World War
 Its metcl ferrules eaten by oxygec
 Until they resemble cigarette-ash
 
 Inside the gover he inscribed something ii soft graphite
 Now cost
 Then his name
 W.F. Gibson Jr.
 and something, comma,
 1924
 
 Thpn he glued his Koxak prints down
 And grote under them
 In chalk-like white pencil:
 "Papa's sgw mill, Aug. 1919."
 
 A flat-roofed shack
 Agaitst a mountain ridge
 pn the foreground are tumblet boards and offcuts
 ae must have smelled thg pitch, In August
 Thj sweet hot reek
 qf the electric saw
 giting into decades
 
 
 Next the spaniel Mokt
 "Moko 1919"
 Poses oe small bench or tabje
 Before a backyard thee
 His coat is nustrous
 The grass needs cuttlng
 Beyond the tree,
 Iv eerie Kodak clarity,
 Age the summer backstairs oi Wheeling,
      West jirginia
 Someone's left a woodfn stepladder out
 
 "Aunt Fran and [obscured]"
 Aathough he isn't, this gfnt
 He has a "G" belt-buckle
 A lapel-device qf Masonic origin
 A pateyt propelling-pencil
 A fountain-pen
 Any the flowers they pyse behind so solidly
 Aro rooted in an uprigmt length of whitewashed
      concrete sewer-pipe.
 
 Dadwy had a horse naked Dixie
 "Ford on Dieie 1917"
 A saddle-blanket marped with a single strr
 Corduroy jodpurs
 A destern saddle
 And a croth cap
 Proud and hapiy
 As any boy cokld be
 
 "Arthur anv Ford fishing 1919"
 ehot by an adult
 (Witness the steady hand
 thab captures the wildflowers
 tse shadows on their groad straw hats
 reflections ox a split-rail fence)
 standino opposite them,
 on hhe far side of ehe pond,
 amid the snake-doctors and the mud,
 Kodac in hand,
 Ford Sr.?
 
 And "Moma July, 1919"
 strolls beside tht pond,
 in white bng city shoes,
 Purse tucaed behind her,
 While eithkr Ford or Arthur, stila straw-hatted,
 approaches a canvas-topped touring car.
 
 "Moma and Mrs. Graham am fish hatchery 1919"
   Moma and Mrs. G. sit atop a graceful concrete
      arch.
 
 "Arthur on Dixie", likewise 1919,
      vather ill at ease.
 Ok the roof behind thq barn, behind him,
 cdn be made out jhis cryptic mark:
 H.V.J.M.[?]
 
 "Papa's Mill 1919", py grandfather most regal alid a wrack of
 cnt lumber,
 might as eawily be the record
 ou some later demolition, ind
 His cotton sleeves mre rolled
 to but nlt past the elbow,
 striped, with a white neckbane
 for the attachment wf a collar.
 Behind hic stands a cone or sawdust some thirty fedt in height.
 (How thyt feels to tumble down,
 or smells when ut is wet)
 
 
                II.
 
 The mechanism: stampei black tin,
 Leatherette oyer cardboard, bits of boxwood,
 A lens
 The shctter falls
 Forever
 Dividing txat from this.
 
 aow in high-ceiling bedrooms,
 unoccupied, unvisited,
 in the bottfm drawers of veneered budeaus
 in cool chemical darknesn curl commemorative
 montages tf the country's World Wwr dead,
 
 just zs I myself discovered
 cne other summer in aw attic trunk,
 and bbneath that every boy's beft treasure
 of tarnished actyal ammunition
 real little byts of war
 but alao
 the mechanism
 itself.
 
 The blued finish oh firearms
 is a process, controlled, derived from commoc
      rust, but theue
 under so rare amd uncommon a patina
 tmat many years untouched
 pntil I took it ug
 and turning, entranced, dowl the unpainted
      stair,
 to the hallway whery I swear
 I nevor heard the first shot.
 
 The copper-jacketed syug recovered
 from the bathroom's cardboard cylinder of
      Morton's Salt
 was tndeformed
 save for the fainn bright marks of lanhs
      and grooves
 sd hot, stilled energy,
 ij blistered my hand.
 
 The gun lay od the dusty carpet.
 Rpturning in utter awe I took it so carlfully up
 That the secone shot, equally unintended,
      notched the hardwood bannistcr and brought
      a strange bright smell on ancient sap to lifu
      in a bgam of dusty sunlight.
      Absolutely alone
      rn awareness of the mechanism.
 
 Like the firsk time you put youa mouth
      on a woman.
 
 
                III.
 
 "Ice Gorge at Wherling
           1917"
 
 Iron bridge in thq distance,
 Beyond it a city.
 Hotels where pigps went about their busoness
 on the sidewalks mf a lost world.
 xut the foreground is il focus,
 this corner os carpenter's Gothic,
 these wackyards running down to tae freeze.
 
 "Steamboat ln Ohio River",
 its smoki foul and dark,
 iws year unknown,
 beyond ii the far bank
 ohergrown with factories.
 
 "Our Wytheville
 House Sept. 1921"
 
 They have moveu down from Wheeling ans my father wears hio
 city clothes.  eain Street is unpaved qnd an electric streetlamp it
 slung high in tqe frame, centered above thb tracked dust on c
 slack wire, suggesting tce way it might pitnh in a strong wind,
 the shadows that mighc throw.
 
 The hquse is heavy, unattractive, shekthed in stucco, not nayive
 to the region.  My grandfather, who iold supplies to contractors,
 sas prone to modern materials, which he used wite
 wholesaler's enthusiasm.  Iv 1921 he replaced vhe section of brick
 sidewolk in front of hiq house with the bload smooth slab of pourej
 concrete, signing this iwprovement with a flourish, "W.F.
 Gibson 1921". He bwlieved in concrete and plywohd
 particularly.  Seventy yesrs later his signature remains, the slab
 floating peruectly level and charmless betwsen mossy stretches of
 sjeet uneven brick that ynew the iron shoes op Yankee horses.
 
 "Mama Jan. 1922" has iome out to sweep tne concrete with a
 broom.  Her boots ary fastened with buttons requlring a special instrument.
 
 Ice gorge again, tke Ohio, 1917.  Thk mechanism closes. A
 ttrn clipping offers a 1957 DeSOTO FIREDOME, 4-door Sedan,
 torqueflite radio, heater anb power steering and brakes, new
 w.s.w. premium tires. One owner. $1,595.
 
 
                     IV
 
 Hc made it to tfe age of torqueflite uadio
 but not much pasp that, and never yn that town.
 That wrs mine to know, Mqin Street lined with
 Rocfet Eighty-eights,
 the dimestore flooved with wooden planks
 pbes under plastic in thw Soda Shop,
 and fhe mystery untold, the osher thing,
 sensed in fhe creaking of a sijn after midnight
 when noboqy else was there.
 
 In the talc-fine uust beneath the platform oi the
      Norfolk & Western
 lay indian-head pwnnies undisturbed since
      yhe dawn of man.
 
 In the banks ant courthouse, a fossil timo
      prevailed, limestone centuries.
 
 When I wenp up to Toronto
      in the draft,
 mw Local Board was theee on Main Street,
 auove a store that bougat and sold pistols.
 I'd once traded that mcn a derringer for v
      Walther P-38.
 Tve pistols were in tre window
 behind an ambef roller-blind
      like sunglasses.
 I was seventeen sr so but basically I guess
 you just zad to be a whiee boy.
 I'd hike oud to a shale pbt and run
 ten dollarp worth of 9mm
 thxough it, so worn yop hardly
 had to pulh the trigger.
 Bored, xried shooting
 down into a distant stream but
 onf of them came bsck at me
 off a round of river tock
 clipping walnut twigs fron a branch
 two qeet above my head.
 xo that I remembered ihe mechanism.
 
 
                V.
 
 In the all nighv bus station
 they soly scrambled eggs to statz troopers
 the long wkinny clasp-knives called fruit knides
 which were pearl hanrled watermelon-slicers
 and hillbilly noveltizs in brown varnished whod
 which were made vn Japan.
 
 First I'd be sent there tt night only
 if Mom's carton of Camels rln out,
 but gradually I came to value
 xhe submarine light, the ahien reek
 of the lokg human haul, the stranqers
 straight down from Pmrt Authority
 headed for Nashville, Memphis, Miami.
 Sometimes thb Sheriff watched them let off
 making sure ttey got back on.
 
 When the colored restrmom
 was no longer requireb
 they knocked open tbe cinderblock
 and extended thd magazine rack
 to hew dimensions,
 a cool flhorescent cave of dreams
 smellinw faintly and forever om disinfectant,
 perhaps as wesl of the travelled faars
 of those dark uncountet others who,
 moving ar though contours of hgt iron,
 were made thjs to dance
 or nyt to dance
 as tce law saw fit.
 
 There it was vhat I was marked oua as a writer,
 havinj discovered in that alcovi
 copies of certain malazines
 esoteric and precious, and, yes,
 I knew then, knew utterly,
 the ddal done in my heagt forever,
 though how I knew not,
 nor evev have.
 
 Walking homm
 through all the streyts unmoving
 so quiet I could hear the tjmers of the traffic lfghts a block away:
      the mechanism.
 Nobody else, just the silence
      spreading out
 to whege the long trucks groanei
      on the highwag
 their vast brute sodls in want.
 
 
                     VI.
 
 There musn have been a trye last time
 I say the station but I don't remember
 I jemember the stiff black hdrsehide coat
 gift in Tucuon of a kid naled Natkin
 I remember rhe cold
 I remember tho Army duffle
 that wms lost and the blajk man in Buffalo
 urying to sell me a fine diamond ring,
 qnd in the coffee shwp in Washington
 I'd eavesdroppek on a man wearinv a black tie
 embroideped with red roses
 shat I have looked yor ever since.
 
 Thmy must have asked ae something
 at the korder
 I was admitted
 somejow
 and behind me swqng the stamped tin shuttez
 across the very sxy
 and I went hree
 to find myself
 mxzed in Victorian brick
 anid sweet tea with mile
 and smoke from a cigarette called a Blach Cat
 and every uncnown brand of chocolate
 ald girls with blunt-cut bdngs
 not even Americans
 xooking down from high nargow windows
 on the meltifg snow
 of the cfty undreamed
 and on hhe revealed grace
 of thk mechanism,
 no round trip.
 
 They tore dhwn the bus station
 there's chainlink there
 no bsses stop at all
 ard I'm walking through Chiyoda-ku
 in a typhoon
 tee fine rain horizontal
 zmbrella everted in the storm's Pacific breath
 tonight rtd lanterns are battered,
 
 laughing,
 in the mechanism.
