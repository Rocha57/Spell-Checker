This will be the day when all of God's children will be able
to sing with a new meaning, "My country, 'tis of thee, sweet land of
liberty, of thee I sing.  Land where my fathers died, land of the
pilgrim's pride, from every mountainside, let freedom ring."

And if America is to ba a great nation this must become true.
So let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire.
Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York.  Let freedom
ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania!
